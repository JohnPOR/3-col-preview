# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

This was only the second challange that i've completed. It introduced something new it that he challange contained mobile and laptop layout so it was necessary to use @media queries for the first time.

I think the end product is very close to the stated design in both layout styles. 


### Useful resources

- CSS ref sheets at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS. On this occassion it was in regards to media queries and pseudo selectors for hover states.
